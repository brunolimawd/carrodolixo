## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you want to collaborate, whether that is with a new feature or fixing a bug, we recommend you...

1. Have a look at the [issue tracker](https://github.com/brunolimawd/carrodolixo/issues) first--to make sure there isn't anyone working on that already.
* If it's a new issue/feature, or no one is working on it already, fork the project in GitHub (you'll need an account if you don't have it yet).
* Create the bug to let us know you want to work on this. That way we are aware of and can keep an eye on it, or maybe tell you that it is not a bug but an intended feature, and save you the hassle of working on something that is not needed.
* Clone your fork to your computer (i.e. get the code onto your computer)
* Make a new branch, and switch to that new branch
* Do the changes you deem necessary
* Push the branch to GitHub
* Send a pull request

To make your changes as easy to merge back onto the project as possible, you should only work on one feature per branch. That makes code review simpler and faster!
